Milestone 1:

Colours is an app that lets users find an appropriate color scheme. There are two different modes in this app,
  first one being "scheme" which lets the user generate five random colors and displays their hex values. 
  The second mode "outline" which lets users gain control of the sliders to pick a color of their choice and
  the hex value of that particular color is displayed as well.
 
 My app's intended audience would be designers or anyone who is looking for a fast and easy way to find a color 
  schemes. This app will be a simple app which will let anyone with an iOS device to find an appropriate color
  of their choice. This app will be free and ad free.
  
 Color Picker and Coolors are two app which are similar to my app. I want to make a better UI for my app compared
  to Color Picker and also make my app free compared to Coolors. 
 
 My app will be fairly simple but the main focus will be on the minimalistic design and a simple user interface. 
  I might use color formulas, if needed from the web.
